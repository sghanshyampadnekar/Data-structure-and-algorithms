HASH TABLES
Hashing is a technique used for storing and retrieving information as quickly as possible. 


Elements are stored as key/value pairs.

Common Operations of Hash Table are:-
-> Create HashTable: Creates a new Hash Table.
-> Hash Search: Searches the key in HashTable.
-> Hash Insert: Inserts new keys into HashTable.
-> Hash Delete: Delete a key from HashTable.
->Delete HashTable: Deletes the HashTable.

Four Key Components of Hashing
-> HashTable  
		Hash Tables are key value pair.
		Hash Tables is a generalization of arrays, with an array, we can store the elements whose key is k at a position k of an array.

->Hash Function
	The Hash Function takes a string of characters called keys and map it to a value of ceratin length called a hash value or hash

-> Collision
	A Hash function derives a small number from a big key, there is a chance that two keys would have the same value.

Here there are 5  Keys and  4 strings, all 4 strings have the same key, therefore collision occurred
A collision is when a key maps to an already occupied slot in the table.
->Collision Reslution Technique

(1) Chaining
	make each cell of the table point to a linked list, ie we make the value part of the table a linked list.

(2) Open Addressing
In this method, values are stored in the hash table itself
if the hash index of a key is available, insert it directly into the table
if the hash index of the key is not an available problem until an available slot is found

Best Case Time Complexity
Insert - O(1)
Search - O(1)
Delete - O(1)
