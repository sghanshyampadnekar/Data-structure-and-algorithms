QUEUE
A queue is a simple data structure for storing data.
A queue is a linear data structure that has the order of First in first out (FIFO).

Real-life example:-  

A Queue of people at a concert

The person who first gets into the queue is the one who first enters the concert. the person who joins the last queue enters the concert at last(FIFO).

Operations in a Queue:-
EnQueue() :- Insert an element at the end of the queue
Dequeue() :- Removes an element from front of the queue.
front() :- Returns the element at the front without removing it.
queueSize() :- Retuns the no of elements stored in the queue.
isEmptyQueue() :- Check whether the queue is full or empty.



class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.q = []

    def enqueue(self, x):
        self.q.append(x)

    def dequeue(self):
        self.q.pop(0)

    def front(self):
        if len(self.q) == 0:
            return None
        else:
            return self.q[0]
