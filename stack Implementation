STACK
A stack is a simple data structure for storing data.
A stack is a linear data structure that has the order of last in first out (LIFO).
Real-life example:-  
Pile of Plate

We can visualize a stack like a pile of plates placed on top of each other. Each plate below the topmost plate cannot be directly accessed until the plates above are removed. plates can be added and removed from the top only. (LIFO)

Operations in a stack:-
Main operations:-
push()-> add element into stack
pop()-> removal of element from the top of the stack
Auxiliary operations:-
top()-> returns element on top of the stack
size()->returns no. of elements stored in the stack
isEmptyStack()-> indicates whether any element is stored in the stack or not
isFullStack() -> indicates whether stack is full or not



class stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.con=[]

    def push(self,value):
        self.con.append(value)

    def pop(self):
        return self.con.pop()

    def top(self):
        print (self.con[-1])

    def empty(self):
        if (len(self.con)==0):
            return True
        else:
            return False
